Mention <a href="http://www.dungeonsdragonscartoon.com/2009/08/dungeon-master.html" rel="external">The Dungeon Master</a> to anyone of a certain age and it instantly conjures up a cartoon image of a sweet, little guy who assists a group of kids who have found themselves trapped in the realm of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(TV_series)" rel="external">Dungeons and Dragons</a>, by giving them cryptic clues to help them find the portal back home.

Yes, however these things always have baddies, and one of the baddies just happen to be an alien race called the Olmecs. (Confused yet?). This picture is of King Menator, the leader of the Olmecs, and yes he was pretty evil.

At some point in my childhood The Dungeon Master and King Menator got muddled up, (we can all see why right?), and whilst I had nightmares about one I actually thought I was having nightmares about the other.

Today's lesson: Be careful about what you think you know, things are not always what they seem.
