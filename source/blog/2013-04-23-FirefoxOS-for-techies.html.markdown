So your twitter feed was ary with geeksphone tweets this morning, but what's it all about?

Lets start at the beginning :) Some time last year Mozilla started developing software that could run on devices such as mobile phones. (Smart phones?) This is firefoxOS. Think iOS or Android - you will see a very similar thing when you see a phone running firefoxOS - a nice flick through interface with icons representing the apps installed.

The one big difference is apps are built on web technology - HTML CSS & Javascript. On top of the hardware - i this case a mobile phone - you have gonk, which is the linux kernal running hardware drivers and other system shizzle - this is actually the same as android phones. Then on top of that you have gecko which is firefox's render engine (if youve heard of the term boot to gecko this is where it comes from - u essentialy are booting into gecko) , then finally for the phones being released now you have gaia, which is the front end suite of apps.

The geeksphones youve been hearing about are an initial release of phones running firefoxos aimed at developers so they can start developing and testing apps on them - we can look ar them as an indicator?

So why bother i hear you ask - we've already got iphones, a million androids - some of which are quite affordable and ubuntu released a mobile operating system themselves (more here?)

Well firstly theres the affordability - the cheaper geeksphone that just got released is $ -this indicates its not a competitor to the new iphone or android which you're looking at around $ for. Mozilla are planning to launch firefoxOS phones on a more public basis (contracts) etc... In south america. Not really the rich american or european market we may assume they are targeting. One where a smart phone for under $100 becomes a sort after thing.

Secondily and the bit im most excited about - developers can use open web technologies to develop apps. Chances are if youve coded something in HTML CSS and javascript youve already built an app. If youre thinking about how you access the hardware through web technologies theres a whole bunch of webapis which have been developed or are being developed which you may want to check out.

If you didnt managed to get your hands on a mobile theres a firefoxOS simulator add on for firefox the browser - which u can download and install like any other add on. Mozilla recommends you use it with firefox nightly so u get thelateat version of gecko.

All in all With a firefox os phone it's not about web vs native - its both! I think thats pretty genius and personally extremely exciting.
