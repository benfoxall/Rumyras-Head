Isn't that amazing!

I'm totally chuffed. Some lovely person/people actually nominated <a href="http://dancing.rumyra.com/">this demo</a>. (NB The last two links work best on an android device with vibrate functionality ;) )

<br />
I'd really luv to get to the shortlist... the voting for that closes at the end of March (24th), if you want to vote for me you <a href="https://thenetawards.com/vote/demo/ruth-john-make-your-browser-dan/">can here</a>.

Thank you in advance you lovely peeps :D
