<p>I got into crochet a couple of years ago. I was bought a book on how to do it, by my then housemates, cos they knew I liked making stuff. And so I sat there and taught myself how to do it. (If you're unsure what crochet is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet" rel="external">it's a bit like knitting but instead of two needles you have one hook</a>).</p>
<p>I really liked it a lot, one of the main reasons was it was so portable. All you needed was a hook and some sort of yarn. It meant I could take it anywhere and if I was sat on a train, waiting for a bus, sitting in front of the telly, I could still be making something.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>I like making crochet stuff for other people too.</p>
<p>Something happened this morning where I received a really lovely email thanking me for something I had made.</p>
<p>It made me feel really good. I really enjoy crochet so, (although it may take some time), I'm quite happy to make crochet things for other people.</p>
<p>Then when people come back and say they enjoy the thing that I enjoyed making, I feel it's a win win situation.</p>
<p>I don't feel like I've made enough stuff digitally this year. I've been caught up in worrying about stuff, stuff that's probably not worth worrying about.</p>
<p>My new years resolution: Stop worrying and make something.</p>
<p>Maybe I should get that printed on a t-shirt.</p>
<p>Maybe I should make the t-shirt.</p>
