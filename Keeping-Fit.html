    <p>This comes up time and again with peers in the industry. How do you stay fit, keep the weight off and not end up a big fat blob whilst sitting at your computer all day. TLDR: not really sure, read on :P</p>

<p>History</p>

<p>I wasn't a very 'sporty' child, I wasn't unhealthy either. I grew up in the country, bike riding, playing at the rec, I was on the school netball team, not for my running around skills, but becuase I could throw a ball in a hoop.</p>

<p>College and University were pretty excercise free for me, apart from the all night weekend parties where I danced a LOT. It wasn't until my first job did I join a gym and pretty much enjoyed it. This was my early-mid twenties, I was a good size 10 back then (6 in american sizes), and pretty healthy.</p>

<p>Then I moved to London - the long underpaid hours of agencies and expensive, crowded gyms meant excercise went out the window. The drinking culture matched with bad eating habits meant I went to London just over 9 stone, I left 7 years later having put on nearly half of my original body weight, 13 stone.</p>

<p>This was just over 2 years ago. I haven't stopped trying to shift the weight.</p>

<p>When I originally left, I dropped a stone just because of the lifestyle change. Country dog walking, a better home cooked diet and less alcohol meant this easilly dropped off, the rest however seems to not want to shift.</p>

<p>It's probably worth mentioning I stopped smoking around this time as well… great for the lungs, less so for the appetite.</p>

<p>I trained for the swimming part of a triathalon last year. I swam 750m in under half an hour, after starting the training not really being able to front crawl. It was a great achievement for me, I was in the gym and swimming pool 4 times a week.</p>

<p>I didn't loose any weight.</p>

<p>I took part in one of those gym 'get a beach body in 3 months'. They helped me with excercise and diet, which I stuck to well, again in the gym 4 times a week, eating 1500 calories or so a day. I lost 2kg (about 3-4lbs) over 3 months. I should have been loosing that every 3 weeks, not 3 months.</p>

<p>This year I started it by doing the 'Insanity' workout. It's 9 weeks long and you excercise every day bar one, and do you excercise - don't get me wrong I felt stronger and fitter after I finished the course. But I also felt injured and tired, my clothes were no looser, I had not lost any weight. Anyone who has tried Insanity knows you burn about 600 calories a day.</p>

<p>After this I took some time out of excercising, I felt it was taking up a lot of my time with no reward. Over the summer tho I started running, not something I've ever felt I'd be interested in.</p>

<p>Now I run 3 times I week. I've built it up to about 5km, which takes me around 40mins.</p>

<p>In about 4 months of running, I haven't lost any weight.</p>

<p>I now what you're thinking - diet and no I haven't mentioned diet yet. I don't eat badly, I cook for myself pretty much every evening. I like meat and veg, curries, steamed fish, borritoes. I don't under eat, but I don't overeat either. With all that excercise I didn't think I would need to.</p>

<p>Back at the net mag awards in the spring, I finally had a good ol' natter with Hannah Wolfe who told me about the '4 hour diet'. Since then I have cut out carbs and sugar from my diet (you cut out dairy too, but I was already dairy free). I do struggle with this, it's the sugar part i find the hardest and no rice with curries is also hard. I don't stick to it religiously and I haven't found I've lost any weight, but it does make me feel better. There's no calories counting, as long as you stick to the prescribed foods.</p>

<p>Now I just feel this is my size, maybe this was the size I was always suppose to be. I think I'm healthy, I exercise and eat well, it's just not reflected in what you see.</p>

<p>I think it's time I stopped chasing that 21 year old size 10 body and sign up for a 10km run.</p>

<p>That would be a better achievement.</p>
